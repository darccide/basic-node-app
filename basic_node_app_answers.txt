1. What is a Node module?


   A: A Node module is a set of functions to include 
      in your application. You can consider modules 
      to be the same as JavaScript libraries.

2. What is the main difference between `exports` and 
   `module.exports`?

   A: `module.exports` is the object returned from require(). 
       It is an empty object by default, and it can be reassigned
       to anything. `exports` is a reference to module.exports.

3. Why is using `exports` recommended?

   A:  `exports` cannot reassign the object module.exports so it is 
       preferable.
